Install Tailprops and the Rollup plugin as dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D tailprops rollup-plugin-tailprops
```

Add the plugin to your `vite.config.js` or `rollup.config.js`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import preact from "@preact/preset-vite";
import { tailpropsPlugin } from "rollup-plugin-tailprops";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [preact(), tailpropsPlugin({ framework: "preact" })],
});
```

Finally generate the types and the Tailwind transform by running:

```bash
npx tailprops init preact
```

## Supported frameworks

As standalone frameworks, the Rollup plugin supports React and Preact.

It also supports full SSR frameworks such as [SvelteKit](/integrations/sveltekit) and [Astro](/integrations/astro), so make sure to follow the respective integration guides if you're using one of those.
