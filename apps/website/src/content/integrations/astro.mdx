Make sure you added the Tailwind integration via `astro add tailwind` before continuing.

## Adding Tailprops to Astro

Install Tailprops and the Rollup plugin as dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D tailprops rollup-plugin-tailprops
```

Add the plugin to your `astro.config.mjs`:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "astro/config";
import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";
import { tailpropsPlugin } from "rollup-plugin-tailprops";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [tailwind()],
  vite: {
    plugins: [tailpropsPlugin({ framework: "astro" })], // Add our Rollup plugin here
  },
});
```

Finally generate the types and the Tailwind transform by running:

```bash
npx tailprops init astro
```

## Adding Astro integrations (islands)

If you want to use Tailprops in Astro islands too you can do so by adding each integration to the Rollup plugin:

```js
vite: {
  plugins: [tailpropsPlugin({ framework: "astro", integrations: ["react", "preact"] })],
},
```

<Note kind="warning">
  Keep in mind that for integrations to work they need to be supported by our
  [Rollup plugin](/integrations/rollup).
</Note>
