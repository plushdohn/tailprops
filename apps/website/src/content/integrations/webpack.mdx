<Note>
  For now, our Webpack plugin supports React and Preact. We're working on adding
  support for other frameworks.
</Note>

## Installation

Install Tailprops and the Webpack plugin as dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D tailprops tailprops-webpack-plugin
```

Then, add the plugin to your `webpack.config.js`:

```js
// webpack.config.js
const { TailpropsWebpackPlugin } = require("tailprops-webpack-plugin");

module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [
    // ...
    new TailpropsWebpackPlugin(), // Add tailprops to your plugins
  ],
};
```

Lastly, add typings and the Tailwind transform by running:

```bash
npx tailprops init react # or preact
```
