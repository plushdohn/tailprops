This page contains a list of all the integrations available for Tailprops and a setup guide for each one.

## Available integrations

- [Next.js](/integrations/nextjs)
- [SvelteKit](/integrations/sveltekit)
- [Webpack](/integrations/webpack)

We are always looking for new integrations to add to Tailprops. If you have a project that you would like to see supported, please open an issue on GitHub.

## Criteria for new integrations

We generally want to support as many environments as possible, but we give priority based on demand and the complexity of the integration.

We also tend to prefer complete "ways of building an app", instead of single framework-bundler combos. That's why we started with Next.js, followed by SvelteKit.
