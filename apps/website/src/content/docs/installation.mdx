warning: This library is still under very active development. Breaking changes are possible and for now we only support Next.js, SvelteKit and some JSX frameworks with Webpack, but we are very actively working on supporting more bundlers. If you know your way around writing bundler plugins please come help out on GitHub!

## Tailwind setup

Make sure you have Tailwind installed and configured before proceding. If you don't, follow the [Tailwind installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides) for your environment.

## Framework-specific setup

With Tailprops being a compile-time library, the setup depends on your bundler and/or framework.

The integrations section contains a list of the supported frameworks and a setup guide for each one:

- [Next.js](/integrations/nextjs)
- [SvelteKit](/integrations/sveltekit)
- [Webpack](/integrations/webpack)

## Usage

After setting up Tailprops, please have a read at the [usage guide](/docs/usage) to learn how to use Tailprops in your project and how to avoid some common pitfalls.
