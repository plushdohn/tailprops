## Tailwind setup

Make sure you have Tailwind installed and configured before proceding. If you don't, follow the [Tailwind installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides) for your environment.

## Framework-specific setup

With Tailprops being a compile-time library, the setup depends on your bundler and/or framework.

The integrations section contains a list of the supported frameworks and a setup guide for each one:

- [Next.js](/integrations/nextjs)
- [SvelteKit](/integrations/sveltekit)
- [Webpack](/integrations/webpack)
- [Astro](/integrations/astro)
- [Vite/Rollup](/integrations/rollup)

## Usage

After setting up Tailprops, please have a read at the [usage guide](/docs/usage) to learn how to use Tailprops in your project and how to avoid some common pitfalls.
