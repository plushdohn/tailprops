## Quirks

There are two main "quirks" you'll need to know when using this library.

### Tailprops only support simple attributes with double quotes

Our transpiler will error if you try to use an expression in a Tailprop:

```tsx
// This will error
<div tw={open ? "flex" : "hidden"} />
```

This was supported in the very first release (0.0.1), but was intentionally removed for a couple reasons:

- Implementing new frameworks is easier (since our parsing logic gets simpler)
- It further discourages [prop forging](#creating-dynamic-properties)
- The implementation was flimsy and prone to breaking
- It was a bit confusing to opt out of the transformation for some strings in the expression (you had to use template literals or single quotes)
- It did too much magic under the hood that was difficult to foresee by the users of this library.

If you need to use dynamic expressions for your Tailwind classes, use them in your class attribute, and use Tailprops for static styling:

```tsx
<div
  className={open ? "flex" : "hidden"}
  tw="p-8 bg-gray-900 rounded-sm"
  tw-xl="p-16 flex-col"
/>
```

### Tailprops modifiers use underscores instead of hyphens

Tailwind has some modifiers like `first-child:` or `prose-p` that use multiple words separated by a hyphen, but in Tailprops we use the hyphens as the modifier separator.

So to obtain this:

```html
<div class="first-child:bg-red-500 prose-p:bg-white" />
```

You have to use these Tailprops (note the underscores):

```html
<div tw-first_child="bg-red-500" tw-prose_p="bg-white" />
```

## How to pass Tailprops to custom components

Our parser greedily looks for elements that contain attributes that start with `tw` in your file, it then deletes those attributes and appends (or creates) the class attribute on that element.

This means that even for your custom components, when you write something like this:

```jsx
<CustomComponent tw="bg-black" />
```

The compiler will turn it into this:

```jsx
<CustomComponent class="bg-glack" />
```

So the only thing you need to do is make sure that your component accepts an optional `class` (or `className`) prop and that it passes it down to the related element.

See this example in React:

```tsx
const CustomComponent = ({ className }) => (
  <div className={className}>Hello world</div>
);
```

```jsx
// Now this will work
<CustomComponent tw="bg-black" />
```

## Creating dynamic properties

Another thing to keep in mind is that we can't "forge" properties at build-time:

```tsx
<div
  tw={`bg:${pinkTheme ? "pink" : "black"}`} // This will most likely never be supported
/>
```

This limitation [also exists in Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#dynamic-class-names).
