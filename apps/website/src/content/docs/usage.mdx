## Quirks

There are two main "quirks" you'll need to know when using this library.

### Tailprops only transform code inside double quotes

Our transpiler **doesn't transform code inside single quotes or backticks** (for template literals).

This was a deliberate decision for three reasons:

- Implementing new frameworks is easier (since our parsing logic gets simpler)
- It further discourages [prop forging](#creating-dynamic-properties)
- Allows you to opt out of our transformation by writing strings in template literals

### Tailprops modifiers use underscores instead of hyphens

Tailwind has some modifiers like `first-child:` or `prose-p` that use multiple words separated by a hyphen, but in Tailprops we use the hyphens as the modifier separator.

So to obtain this:

```html
<div class="first-child:bg-red-500 prose-p:bg-white" />
```

You have to use these Tailprops (note the underscores):

```html
<div tw-first_child="bg-red-500" tw-prose_p="bg-white" />
```

## How to pass Tailprops to custom components

Our parser greedily looks for elements that contain attributes that start with `tw` in your file, it then deletes those attributes and appends (or creates) the class attribute on that element.

This means that even for your custom components, when you write something like this:

```jsx
<CustomComponent tw="bg-black" />
```

The compiler will turn it into this:

```jsx
<CustomComponent class="bg-glack" />
```

So the only thing you need to do is make sure that your component accepts an optional `class` (or `className`) prop and that it passes it down to the related element.

See this example in React:

```tsx
const CustomComponent = ({ className }) => (
  <div className={className}>Hello world</div>
);
```

```jsx
// Now this will work
<CustomComponent tw="bg-black" />
```

## Creating dynamic properties

One thing we can't do is "forge" properties, for example:

```tsx
<div
  tw={`bg:${pinkTheme ? "pink" : "black"}`} // This will most likely never be supported
/>
```

This limitation [also exists in Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#dynamic-class-names). We can't support it because your property now depends on a variable which in turn may depend on your framework's reactivity system, something we can't rely on at compile-time.

For most of these cases, you can just extract the property name and change the condition to this:

```tsx
<div tw-hover={pinkTheme ? "bg-pink" : "bg-black"} />
```

Which will compile to a ternary for the class attribute with the correct modifier:

```tsx
<div class={pinkTheme ? "hover:bg-pink" : "hover:bg-black"} />
```
