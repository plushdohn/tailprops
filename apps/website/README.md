# Tailprops.dev

This is the repository for the Tailprops website. It's a Next 13 website using the app/ directory (and Tailprops, obviously).

As of now it's the most complete example of how to integrate Tailprops into a "big" app. It contains a lot of examples on how to use Tailprops in different scenarios.
